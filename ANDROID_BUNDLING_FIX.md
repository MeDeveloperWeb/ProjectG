# Android Bundling Fix Summary

## Issue
Android bundling was failing with a syntax error in contacts.tsx related to TypeORM entity imports:
```
ERROR  SyntaxError: Missing initializer in const declaration. (18:17)
```

## Root Cause
The issue was caused by conflicts between TypeORM entity decorators and the Android bundler's handling of TypeScript decorators. The React Native bundler on Android was having trouble processing the imported TypeORM entities with their decorators.

## Solution
Replaced direct TypeORM entity imports with simple TypeScript interfaces in the React components:

### Before (Problematic):
```typescript
import { Contact } from '@/entities/Contact';
const ContactItem: React.FC<{ contact: Contact; onPress: () => void }> = ...
```

### After (Fixed):
```typescript
// Simple interface for TypeScript compatibility
interface ContactInterface {
  id: number;
  name: string;
  phone: string;
  avatar?: string;
}
const ContactItem: React.FC<{ contact: ContactInterface; onPress: () => void }> = ...
```

## Files Updated
1. **app/contacts.tsx** - Replaced `Contact` entity with `ContactInterface`
2. **app/messages.tsx** - Replaced `Message` entity with `MessageInterface`
3. **app/notifications.tsx** - Replaced `Notification` entity with `NotificationInterface`
4. **components/StatusBar.tsx** - Updated notification type handling

## Benefits
- ✅ Resolves Android bundling issues
- ✅ Maintains full type safety
- ✅ Preserves all functionality
- ✅ Keeps TypeORM entities intact for database operations
- ✅ No impact on the database service layer

## Technical Details
The TypeORM entities with decorators are still used in the database service layer (`services/typeormDatabase.ts`), but the React components now use simple interfaces that mirror the entity structure. This provides the same type safety without the bundler conflicts.

The database service automatically handles the conversion between TypeORM entities and the interface types, ensuring seamless operation.
